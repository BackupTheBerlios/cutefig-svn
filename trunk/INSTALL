The CuteFig is in an early-pre alpha state. So installing it might be
not easy. As the CuteFig is not meant to be used by end users at this
point of development I assume that you are familiar with the way free
software is developed and and installed.

You need to do the following steps:

  * The release candidate 1 of the Qt-libs version 4.1. You can get this
    from http://www.trolltech.com. Read their installing instructions
    and install the Qt-libs. 

  * As soon as you succeeded to build Qt, you should be able to build
    the CuteFig as well. It follows the build process propagated by
    the trolls for Qt, i.e. it uses qmake to make its Makefiles. So
    what you need to do is:

    qmake && make

  * Then start the executable gui_app/cutefig, play around with it and
    tell me about bugs and inconsistencies. Do not bother me with
    missing features though unless you want to implement them.


Good luck
